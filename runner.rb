# The sudoku puzzles that your program will solve can be found

# Currently, Line 18 defines the variable board_string to equal
# the first puzzle (i.e., the first line in the .txt file).
# After your program can solve this first puzzle, edit
# the code below, so that the program tries to solve
# all of the puzzles.
#
# Remember, the file has newline characters at the end of each line,
# so we call String#chomp to remove them.
